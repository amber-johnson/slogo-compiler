# Slogo Compiler Project

### Technologies/skills demonstrated
* Java/Java FX/Javadoc
* Properties files
* Exception handling
* User input and controls

### Code samples
For an example of parsing user input collected from the UI, please see the [Parser class](https://github.com/amber-johnson/slogo-compiler/blob/master/cs-308-slogo-project-master/src/slogo/backend/parser/Parser.java).

### Background
I worked on this project as part of a software design class in the Computer Science (CS) Department at Duke University. The course was CS 308: Advanced Software Design and Implementation and was taught by Dr. Robert C. Duvall. I was enrolled for the Fall 2019 semester, and I had three partners for the project who were undergraduate students in the CS department.

### Project structure
Please see the [README file](cs-308-slogo-project-master/README.md) included in our project submission for a breakdown of java classes and individual contributions.  Please see the [documentation folder](cs-308-slogo-project-master/doc) for details on API design and implementation.
